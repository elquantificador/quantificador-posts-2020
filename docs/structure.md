# Repository structure

Each folder groups the code and data used for a set of blog posts. Below is a short summary of what you can find in every top-level directory.

- **corrupcion** – Articles dealing with corruption. Contains RMarkdown files.
- **economia** – Posts on economics. Each subfolder stores an RMarkdown file and related data.
- **salud** – Health related posts. Directories contain the RMarkdown file together with the required datasets.
- **socioeconomia** – Socio‑economic analyses and their scripts.
- **twitter** – Analyses based on Twitter data (for example word clouds for the 2021 elections).
- **valores** – Posts related to values, usually including raw data in Stata or R format.
- **databases** – Large shared datasets used across various posts (e.g. ENEMDU, ENSANUT).

This repository uses an RStudio project (`elquantificador_posts.Rproj`) so all paths are relative to the project root.
